                how my heart pumps after seeing it , my face automatically breaks into smile , your smile makes my day 
                when i see you happy and excited it always feels like why cant i just pause this exact moment and lost in your eyes seeing you happy 
                sometimes i think that i only live just to see you happy 
                its so precious to me that even the most expensive jewel in the world can never replace the feeling of seeing you happy 
                so meri bhondu bacchi always keep smiling 💗">

                you dont even realise how much you help me just by replying once or when you drop a random caring message out of rules
                its something rare which i dont feel with many , and i think thats why i call this love , feeling of relieve
                yk somedays i am so angry at you but then i see your cute face and all my anger just disappears 🤣

                i dont really worry much but you just throw me off blance , your problems become my first priority as if everthing else can wait 
                but not your problems , its really hard for me to tolerate your sad face or when you feel low , missing a moment where i can 
                have helped you and i refused feels like percing a knife in my chest
                i never want to see you sad for any reason i just hate it 
                ,i wish i could just take all the bad moments of your life on me so that you never have to fade your smiles ">

                but i guess its not the same with you , my life was a hell before you entered it was a place where only ego and anger use to live 
                you filled it with joy , happiness , calmness you brought life back to me i really miss those days when we use to go on a regular dates 
                use to talk i changed my city had numeorus burden on me but it never put me off-balance because i had you , enduring any pain for you 
                is not something which hurts me its something which use to make me feel important , you are anchor to my emotions and so i love you and i just love you 
                💗,this valantine i want to confess this to you the way i love you is something which would remain with hating you doesnt exist in my world
